This assignment involves creating a JavaScript application that implements CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for a to-do list. The data will be stored in an array within the JavaScript code.
 
Learning Objectives:
 
Understand CRUD operations.

Practice working with arrays and DOM manipulation.

Implement event listeners for user interaction.

(Optional) Utilize local storage to persist data.
 
 
Create a JavaScript file (script.js) to handle the logic.

Declare an array (tasks) to store to-do items as objects.

Each object should have the following properties (optional for basic functionality):

id: A unique identifier (e.g., timestamp).

text: The actual task text.

completed (optional): A boolean flag indicating if the task is completed (true) or not (false).
 
Implement functions for CRUD operations:
 
Create:

When the "Add Task" button is clicked, get the new task text from the input field.

Validate the input (check if a task is entered).

Create a new task object with the entered text and a unique identifier.

Add the new task object to the tasks array.
 
Read:

Display the existing tasks from the tasks array in the unordered list (<ul>).

Use DOM manipulation (e.g., createElement, appendChild) to create list items for each task.

Optionally, display additional information like task completion status using CSS classes.
 
Update
 
Allow users to edit existing tasks. This could be implemented by:

Double-clicking on a task label to prompt for new text.

Update the corresponding task object in the tasks array with the new text.

Update the displayed list to reflect the changes.
 
Delete:

Provide a way for users to remove tasks. This could involve:

A "Delete" button next to each task.

Removing the corresponding task object from the tasks array.

Update the displayed list to remove the deleted task.
