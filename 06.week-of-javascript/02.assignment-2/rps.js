// user input.
// Computer randomly chooses its move (0-0.33 rock, 0.34-0.66 paper,
//  0.67-1 scissors).
// Winner is determined based on standard rock paper scissors rules.
// Display the result (win, lose, tie) and user/computer choices on 
// the screen.
// Consider adding scorekeeping and a winner declaration for multiple 
// rounds (optional).

// Code Structure:
 
// Use at least one function declaration.
// Use at least one function expression.
// Use at least one arrow function.
// Use at least one anonymous function.
// Use a ternary operator for a concise outcome display 
// Utilize default parameters in a function



// Cheat Mode:
 
// Design a "cheat mode" feature that alters the computer's choice in some
// way (optional).
// Come up with one specific implementation of cheat mode (e.g., computer
// always chooses scissors).
